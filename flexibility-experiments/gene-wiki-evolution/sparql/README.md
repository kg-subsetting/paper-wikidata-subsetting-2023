In this folder, there are three SPARQL queries used to count instances of active-site, binding-site, and biological-pathway classes. For other classes, queries can be written in the same manner, that is, counting all the instances that are related to other items via the `part of` and `has part` links (based on `GeneWiki.shex` schema in the higher folder).
